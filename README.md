## Technologies

- Next.js
- PostgreSQL (hosted on Heroku)
- Facebook OAuth
- Google OAuth

## Why use Next.js?

I was originally tossing up between a traditional Create React App, and Next.js.
There are a couple of main reasons I decided to go for Next.js

- SEO is important to eCommerce. Server side rendering optimises SEO, while client side rendering doesn't do so very well
- The site obviously needs to render dynamic content, which is not great with Gatsby.js
